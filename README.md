# What code were you given?
#
# We were given the outline for the jupyter notebook file and the python files for the game.
#
# What code did you create yourself?
#
# The code that I created was for the intelligent agent and how it learned to reach the treasure before a player.
#
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
#
# Computer scientists are at the forefront of technological innovation, responsible for designing, analyzing, and improving software systems, algorithms, and computational methods.
# Their work spans a wide range of fields, from theoretical foundations of computing, such as computational complexity, to practical applications in software development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.
# The importance of their work cannot be overstated, as it drives advancements that impact nearly every aspect of modern life. Through their contributions, computer scientists enable imrpovements in
# efficiency, security, and accessibility across various sectors, including healthcare, education, communication, and business, thereby playing a critical role in shaping the future of society.
#
# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
#
# Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves a systematic process that starts with thoroughly understanding the problem. This includes breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts and clearly
# defining the problem statement. Next, a computer scientist develops algorithms or logical steps that can be used to solve the problem efficiently. Once the algorithm is designed, it is implemented in code
# using appropriate programming languages and tools. Rigorous testing and debugging follow to ensure the solution works correctly and efficiently. After the initial implementation, the solution may be refined to
# improve performance, scalability, and resource utilization. Throughout the process, proper documentation is essential to ensure that the solution can be understood and maintained by others, making the approach
# both thorough and collaborative.
#
# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
#
# As a computer scientist, ethical responsibilities are paramount, both to the end user and the organization. To the end user, it is essential that the software or system developed is safe, secure, and respects
# their privacy. This includes considering the potential social impact of the technology, including any unintended consequences that may arise. Clear communication about the risk and limitations of the
# technology is also crucial. To the organization, the ethical duties involve maintaining integrity by delivering accurate work, meeting deadlines, and aligning with the organization's goals and standards.
# It is also import to avoid conflicts of interest and respect intellectual property rights. More broadly, computer scientists must uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability in all stages
# of development, being particularly mindful of biases in algorithms and ensuring that the technology does not perpetuate inequality or harm.
